Your project, "Obsidian Thinking Engine," is an ambitious and fascinating endeavor to enhance the utility of your notes in Obsidian by leveraging AI and automation to create more meaningful connections, improve information retrieval, and foster deeper reflections on past thoughts. Here's a structured approach to getting started:

### 1. **Problem Understanding and Scoping**

Before diving into implementation, it's crucial to break down the problem into smaller, manageable chunks. You have multiple objectives, each requiring different techniques and tools. Let's organize them into categories:

- **Cleanup and Maintenance:**
  - Identify and handle orphan notes.
  - Remove redundant notes or merge them.
  - Clean up and standardize tags.
  - Remove dead links or update them.

- **Organization and Retrieval:**
  - Create a Table of Contents (TOC) or overview notes.
  - Classify notes (original vs. non-original).
  - Summarize daily notes.

- **Connection and Reflection:**
  - Automatically create connections between notes.
  - Prompt for reflections on past thoughts (e.g., "memories").
  - Prevent redundancy by suggesting related notes when creating a new note.

- **Integration and Workflow:**
  - Ingest information from external sources (e.g., Instapaper, Zotero).
  - Handle multi-modal content (images, videos, PDFs).

### 2. **Prioritization and Roadmap**

Given the scope, it’s wise to prioritize tasks based on impact and feasibility. Here’s a suggested roadmap:

1. **Cleanup Tasks**: Start with cleaning up orphan notes, dead links, redundant notes, and standardizing tags. These are foundational steps that will simplify further automation.
   
2. **Organizational Tasks**: Once the vault is cleaner, focus on creating TOC or overview notes, tagging, and classifying notes. This will enhance retrieval and understanding.

3. **Enhancing Connections and Reflection**: Build mechanisms to create connections between notes, suggest reflections on past thoughts, and avoid redundant notes.

4. **Integration and Workflow Design**: Finally, design workflows for integrating information from external sources and handling multi-modal content.

### 3. **Identify Existing Tools and Plugins**

Obsidian's ecosystem of plugins might already offer some functionalities that align with your goals:

- **For Cleanup and Maintenance**:
  - **Orphan Notes Plugin**: Identify notes without links.
  - **Dataview Plugin**: Query notes and find redundant or orphan notes.
  - **Tag Wrangler Plugin**: Manage and clean up tags.

- **For Organization and Retrieval**:
  - **Excalidraw or Obsidian Charts**: Create visual TOCs.
  - **Breadcrumbs Plugin**: Build custom navigation between notes.
  
- **For Reflection and Connection**:
  - **Smart Connections Plugin**: Suggest connections between notes based on content similarity.
  - **Periodic Notes Plugin**: Manage daily, weekly, monthly summaries.

- **For Integration**:
  - **Readwise Plugin**: Import highlights from Readwise.
  - **Obsidian Zotero Integration**: Directly pull references from Zotero.

Starting with these plugins allows you to quickly test some concepts without deep development.

### 4. **Design AI/ML Models for Automation**

Several parts of your project can benefit from AI models:

- **Redundancy Detection**: Use NLP models to detect similarity between notes. Sentence-BERT or other transformer-based models can identify semantic similarity.
- **Content Classification**: Train a model to classify notes into original, non-original, and quotes. Start with simple keyword-based rules, then gradually move to more sophisticated models.
- **TOC Generation and Clustering**: Topic modeling (e.g., using LDA or BERT-based clustering) can help group similar notes and create meaningful TOCs.
- **Reflection and Prompting Engine**: Develop an AI-based engine that surfaces past notes based on their relevance to current topics. This can leverage embeddings to identify temporally distant yet topically related notes.

### 5. **Build a Modular Architecture**

Given the complexity, it's essential to create a modular architecture. Separate components should handle:

- **Data Ingestion**: Import notes and external content.
- **Data Cleaning and Maintenance**: Orphan note detection, tag standardization, link checking.
- **AI Modules**: Redundancy detection, classification, TOC generation.
- **User Interface and Interaction**: A plugin interface within Obsidian for managing these functionalities.

### 6. **Prototype and Iterate**

Start with a prototype that tackles the most impactful aspect, such as orphan note detection and redundancy merging. Use Python with Obsidian’s API or create a custom plugin for tighter integration.

- Test and refine the algorithms with a small subset of notes.
- Gather feedback from yourself or potential users to understand what works and what doesn’t.
- Iterate on the design and functionality.

### 7. **Set Success Metrics**

Define clear metrics to gauge the project's success:

- **Reduction in Vault Size**: Measure the decrease in the number of redundant or orphan notes.
- **Increase in Connected Notes**: Track the percentage of notes with meaningful connections.
- **Improvement in Retrieval Time**: Test how quickly you can find relevant notes post-implementation.
- **User Satisfaction**: Use qualitative feedback to measure ease of use and perceived value.

### 8. **Consider the Challenges**

- **Handling Multi-modal Content**: Leverage existing tools (like Tesseract for OCR on images) and combine them with text-based processing.
- **Setting Criteria for Automation**: Use user-defined rules and thresholds to refine the criteria for connecting notes, merging redundancy, or suggesting deletions.

### 9. **Documentation and Sharing**

Once developed, consider publishing the tool or plugin for the Obsidian community. It will not only help others but also contribute to your idea of creating a personal brand by sharing thoughtful insights on the process.

### 10. **Ongoing Reflection and Improvement**

Given the reflective nature of this project, periodically review the tool’s effectiveness and make necessary adjustments. This aligns with your goal of continual learning and leveraging past thoughts for future insights.

By approaching the "Obsidian Thinking Engine" project with this structured plan, you’ll create a powerful personal knowledge management tool that is both efficient and inspiring.
